    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450Â°F and wash and dry all produce Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch wedges. Toss potatoes with 1 tsp steak spice and 1 tbsp oil (dbl both for 4 ppl) on a baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven, until golden-brown, 25-28 min.",
    "Roughly chop mushrooms. In a small bowl, combine mayo with mustard. Set aside.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine beef and 1 tsp steak spice (dbl for 4ppl). Form mixture into two 5-inch wide patties (4 patties for 4 people). Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4ppl), then patties. Pan-fry, until cooked through, 4-5 min per side.** Remove pan from the heat then transfer patties to one side of another baking sheet. Sprinkle patties with cheese. Set aside.",
    "Heat same pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4ppl), then mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5-6 min. Sprinkle flour over mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are coated, 1-2 min. Add 1/2 cup water (dbl for 4ppl) and broth concentrate(s) to the pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until sauce thickens, 2-3 min. Season with remaining steak spice.",
    "While saucy mushrooms cook, cut each bun in half then arrange on other side of baking sheet with patties, cut-side up. (NOTE: for 4 ppl, toast buns first, then set aside.) Toast buns and patties in the top of the oven until the cheese melts, 3-4 min. (TIP: Keep your eye on them so they don't burn!)",
    "Spread half the zesty mayo on bottom buns, then top with spring mix, burgers and some mushroom gravy. Finish with top buns. Divide burgers and potato wedges between plates. Spoon remaining mushroom gravy over potato wedges and serve with remaining zesty mayo, for dipping."
