    "680 g Chicken Thighs",
    "2 tbsp Brown Sugar",
    "2 tsp BBQ Seasoning",
    "6 tbsp White Wine Vinegar",
    "2 unit Chicken Broth Concentrate",
    "4 unit Green Onions",
    "340 g Coleslaw Cabbage Mix",
    "4 tbsp Mayonnaise",
    "2 tbsp Ketchup",

  "directions": [
    "Preheat the broiler to high (to toast the buns). If you don't want to toast your buns, you can skip this step.",
    "In a large pot, combine the brown sugar, broth concentrates, BBQ seasoning, 2/3 cup water and 5 tbsp vinegar. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Add the chicken to the pot. Cover with a lid. Poach until the chicken is cooked through, 9-10 min.",
    "Meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. Thinly slice the green onions. In a medium bowl, combine the green onions, coleslaw, mayonnaise, sugar and remaining vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Halve the buns, then arrange them cut-side up on a baking sheet. Toast in the centre of the oven until golden-brown, 30 sec to 1 min. (TIP: Keep your eye on the buns so they don’t burn!)",
    "When the chicken thighs are cooked through, use tongs to remove them from the liquid to a large plate. Add the ketchup to the liquid and continue simmering until it reduces by half the amount, 4-5 min. (The sauce may remain runny and not thicken up.)",
    "Meanwhile, using two forks, shred the chicken into smaller pieces, then stir the shredded chicken back into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Top the buns with the shredded chicken, a bit of coleslaw and the spring mix. Serve the remaining slaw on the side."
