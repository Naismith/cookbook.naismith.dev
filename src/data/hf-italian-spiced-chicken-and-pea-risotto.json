  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 425ËšF. Wash and dry all produce. Combine 4 1/2 cups water (5 1/2 cups for 4 ppl), broth concentrates and 1/4 tsp salt (dbl for 4 ppl) in a medium pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, still covered. While broth comes to a boil, peel, then cut half the onion (whole onion for 4 ppl) into 1/4-inch pieces. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl), then swirl the pan until melted. Add onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 3-4 min. Add garlic. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 1 min.",
    "Add rice to the pan with aromatics. Cook, stirring often, until toasted, 1-2 min. Add 1 cup broth to the pan with rice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until broth is almost completely absorbed. Repeat, adding 1 cup broth at a time, until texture is creamy and rice is tender, 28-33 min. (TIP: The consistency should be similar to oatmeal!) Add peas halfway through cooking. Season with half the chicken salt.",
    "Meanwhile, heat a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat. While the pan heats, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season with pepper, half the Italian Seasoning (use all for 4 ppl) and remaining chicken salt. When the pan is hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then chicken. Cook until golden, 1-2 min per side. (NOTE: Don't overcrowd the pan; cook chicken in 2 batches if needed.) Transfer chicken to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Sprinkle 1 tbsp Parmesan (dbl for 4 ppl) over chicken. Bake in the middle of the oven until chicken is cooked through, 12-14 min.**",
    "When the last addition of broth is almost completely absorbed, add spinach, remaining Parmesan, 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl) and any juices from the baking sheet to the pan with risotto. Cook, stirring often, until spinach wilts and cheese melts, 2-3 min. (TIP: Add 1/4 cup water if risotto is too thick!) Season with salt and pepper, to taste.",
    "Thinly slice chicken. Divide risotto between plates. Arrange chicken over top."
