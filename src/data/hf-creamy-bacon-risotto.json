    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Wash and dry all produce. Heat Guide for Step 2 (dbl for 4 ppl): 1/4 tsp mild, 1/2 tsp medium and 1 tsp spicy! Arrange bacon strips in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake bacon, in the top of the oven, until crispy and cooked through, 14-16 min.** When bacon is crispy, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and set aside",
    "Meanwhile, trim, then cut beans into 1 inch pieces. Toss beans with 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl) and 1/4 tsp chili flakes on another baking sheet. (NOTE: Reference heat guide). Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the middle of the oven, until golden-brown and tender, 8-10 min.",
    "While the beans and veggies roast, in a medium pot, combine 4 1/2 cups water (5 1/2 cups for 4 ppl) and broth concentrate(s). Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. Peel, then mince or grate garlic. Peel, then dice the shallot.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When pan is hot, add 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then shallots. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 1-2 min. Add rice, garlic, vinegar and a sprig of thyme. Stir together, 1 min. Add 1/2 cup broth (use same amount for 4 ppl) from the medium pot and stir until broth has been absorbed by rice.",
    "Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring often, until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender and creamy, 23-25 min. After the last cup of broth has been stirred in and absorbed, remove the thyme, then add the peas. Cook, stirring until peas are warmed through, 1-2 min. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Crumble or roughly chop bacon into bite-sized pieces. Stir in green beans, 2 tbsp butter (dbl for 4ppl) and half the Parmesan into the risotto. Divide risotto between plates. Sprinkle with the bacon and remaining Parmesan."
