  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450ËšF. Wash and dry all produce. Peel, halve carrots lengthwise, then cut into 1/4-inch slices. Add carrots, 1/2 tsp salt and enough water to cover (by approx. 1 inch) to a medium pot (use same for 4 ppl). Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-high. Simmer, partially covered, until very tender, 16-18 min. Drain well and return carrots to the same pot, off heat. Using a potato masher, mash 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl) into carrots until mostly smooth. (TIP: Puree carrots in a food processor for a smoother consistency, if desired.) Season with pepper, to taste.",
    "Meanwhile, cut broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Add broccoli, half the garlic salt, 1/2 tsp Moo Shu Spice Blend and 1 tbsp oil (dbl both for 4 ppl) to a parchment-lined baking sheet, then toss to coat. Roast in the middle of the oven, stirring halfway through, until tender-crisp, 12-14 min.",
    "Meanwhile, thinly slice green onion, keeping white and green parts separate. Stir together honey, 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp water (dbl both for 4 ppl) in a small bowl. (NOTE: This is your honey-soy mixture.)Add turkey, panko, remaining soy sauce, remaining garlic salt and 1 tsp Moo Shu Spice Blend (dbl for 4 ppl) to a large bowl. Season with pepper, to taste, then combine. Form turkey mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties (8 patties for 4 ppl). Sprinkle sesame seeds over both sides of patties, pressing down gently to adhere.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then patties. Cook, until sesame seeds are golden-brown, 2-3 min per side. Remove the pan from heat. Transfer rissoles to an unlined baking sheet, reserving oil in the pan. Bake in the top of the oven until rissoles are cooked through, 5-7 min.**",
    "When rissoles are almost done, return the pan with reserved oil to medium-high. When hot, add green onion whites, then cook, stirring often, until softened slightly, 30 sec-1 min. Add honey-soy mixture. Cook, stirring often, until mixture reduces slightly, 30 sec. Add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl), then swirl the pan until melted. Transfer honey-soy drizzle back to the same small bowl.",
    "Divide broccoli, carrot mash and rissoles between plates. Spoon honey-soy drizzle over rissoles. Sprinkle remaining green onions over top."
