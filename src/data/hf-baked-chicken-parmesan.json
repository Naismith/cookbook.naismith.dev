  "ingredients": [
    "340 g Chicken Breasts",
    "2 tbsp Mayonnaise",
    "1/2 cup Panko Breadcrumbs",
    "340 g Yukon Potato",
    "170 g Green Beans, trimmed",
    "1/4 cup Tomato Pizza Sauce",
    "56 g Parmesan Cheese, shredded",
    "10 g Garlic",
    "1 tsp Italian Seasoning",
    "Oil"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 450°F (to roast the potatoes and chicken). Start prepping when the oven comes up to temperature!",
    "Wash and dry all produce.* Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch rounds. On a baking sheet, toss the potatoes with Italian seasoning and a drizzle of oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the centre of the oven, flipping them over halfway though cooking, until the potatoes are golden-brown, 25-28 min.",
    "Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the panko into a shallow dish. Coat the chicken all over with the mayonnaise. Working with one chicken breast at a time, press each breast into the panko to coat completely.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil, then the chicken. Pan-fry until golden-brown, 2-3 min per side. (It’s okay if it doesn’t cook all the way through at this step!) Transfer the chicken to a foil-lined baking sheet.",
    "Spoon the pizza sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle the tops with Parmesan. Bake in the centre of the oven until the cheese is golden and the chicken is cooked through, 12-14 min. (TIP: Cook to a minimum internal temperature of 175°F.**)",
    "Meanwhile, mince or grate the garlic. Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil, then the beans and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender-crisp, 5-6 min. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Divide the chicken Parmesan, roasted potatoes and green beans between plates."
