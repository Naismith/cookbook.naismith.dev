	"ingredients": [
		"2 1/2 cups all purpose flour",
		"2 tbsp white sugar",
		"1 tsp salt",
		"1 cup frozen butter",
		"6-8 tbsp ice water"
	],
	"directions": [
		"Whisk flour, sugar and salt together in a large bowl.",
		"Grate frozen butter into flour and toss lightly with your fingers until it's thoroughly combined. Sprinkle in the ice water and stir with your fingers, mixing and firmly kneading until the dough comes together in a ball.",
		"Divide dough into 2 pieces; making sure that one half is slightly larger than the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, flatten and chill for at least 30 minutes or even overnight. Resting tenderizes the pastry, making it easier to roll.",
		"Remove the pastry from and refrigerator and allow it to warm slightly, just until it's pliable. Lightly flour your hands, the rolling pin, your work surface and the dough.",
		"Roll out the larger piece into a circle large enough to slightly overlap the edges of a 9\" glass deep-dish pie dish. As you roll, for ease of handling, lightly flour the dough every time it's diameter doubles, then flip it over and continue rolling. Transfer the dough to the pie dish by folding it into quarter then unfolding it in the dish."
