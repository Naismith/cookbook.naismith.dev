  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450Â°F and wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss potatoes with 2 tbsp oil on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in middle of oven, stirring halfway through cooking, until golden-brown, 25-28 min.",
    "While potatoes roast, roughly chop 3 tbsp sage leaves. Finely chop chives. Zest, then cut lemon into wedges. Cut broccoli into bite-sized pieces.",
    "Toss broccoli with 2 tbsp oil on another baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in top of oven, stirring halfway through cooking, until golden-brown, 8-10 min.",
    "While broccoli roasts, pat pork dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 2 tbsp oil, then pork. Pan-fry, until golden-brown and cooked through, 6-8 min per side.** Transfer pork to a plate. Set aside and cover to keep warm.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 1/4 cup butter in the same pan. Swirl the pan occasionally, until butter melts, smells nutty, foams and looks dark brown, 2-4 min. (TIP: Keep your eye on the butter so it doesn't burn!) Remove the pan from the heat and stir in sage.",
    "Combine sour cream, chives, lemon zest and potatoes in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pork, broccoli and potatoes between plates. Drizzle over sage pan sauce. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, if desired."
