    "Before starting, wash and dry all produce. Combine 2 3/4 cups hot water (dbl for 4ppl) and broth concentrate(s) in a medium pot. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat.

Drain the remaining fat from the pan.",

    "Add couscous and garlic to the pan. Stir together, until garlic is fragrant and couscous is toasted, 1-2 min. Reduce heat to medium and add 1/2 cup broth. Cook, stirring often, until broth has been absorbed by couscous. Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring often, until liquid is absorbed, texture is creamy and couscous is tender, 10-15 min. (NOTE: 15-20 min for 4ppl.)",
