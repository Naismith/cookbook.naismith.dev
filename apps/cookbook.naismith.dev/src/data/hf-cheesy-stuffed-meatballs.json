  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Wash and dry all produce. Add 10 cups water and 2 tsp salt to a large pot. (NOTE: Use same amounts for 4 ppl.) Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, peel, then roughly chop shallot. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.",
    "Combine beef, breadcrumbs, half the pesto and 1/4 tsp salt (dbl for 4 ppl) in a large bowl. Season with pepper. Form beef mixture into 8 equal sized patties (16 for 4 ppl). Add 1 tsp mozzarella in the middle of each patty, then shape and press patty firmly around the cheese, fully enclosing it to create a ball. Repeat until all meatballs are formed.",
    "Add cavatappi to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 9-10 min. Reserve 1/4 cup pasta water (dbl for 4 ppl). Drain cavatappi and return to the same pot, off heat. Add spinach and remaining pesto to cooked cavatappi. Stir until spinach is wilted. Cover and set aside.",
    "While cavatappi cooks, add meatballs to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven, until cooked through, 14-15 min.**",
    "While meatballs cook, heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then shallot and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until softened, 2-3 min. Add crushed tomatoes, reserved pasta water and broth concentrate. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, 2-3 min.",
    "Divide the cavatappi between bowls. Top with meatballs and tomato sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan."
