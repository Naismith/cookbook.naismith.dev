  "ingredients": [
    "1 tbsp oil",
    "1 medium leek",
    "1 bell pepper (I used yellow)",
    "4 medium mushrooms",
    "400 g tin chickpeas, drained (240g, or ~ 1 1/4 cups, when drained)",
    "400 g tinned tomatoes (~ 1 1/3 cups)",
    "2 tbsp tomato puree",
    "1 tbsp medium curry powder",
    "Salt",
    "Black pepper",
    "2 tbsp cream (skip for a vegan curry, or use vegan cream)",
    "To serve: fresh coriander (cilantro) (optional)"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Heat a dash of oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Halve the leek lengthwise, slice it thinly, and add it to the pan. Dice the pepper and mushrooms, and add those too. Cook for a few minutes, stirring regularly, until the vegetables are fairly soft.",
    "Add the chickpeas, tomatoes, tomato puree and curry powder, and mix well. Turn the heat up high, and bring to a simmer. Season to taste, and allow to cook for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened to your desired consistency.",
    "Add the cream if using, and serve topped with fresh coriander."
