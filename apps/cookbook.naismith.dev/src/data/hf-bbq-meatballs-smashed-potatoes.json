  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450Â°F and wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine potatoes, 2 tsp salt and enough water to cover (approx. 1 inch) in a large pot. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium. Simmer, uncovered, until fork-tender, 10-12 min. While the potatoes boil, finely chop chives. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.",
    "Combine beef, breadcrumbs, BBQ seasoning, half the garlic and half the chives in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Roll beef mixture into 8 equal 2-inch sized meatballs (16 for 4 ppl). Transfer meatballs to a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven, until cooked through, 10-12 min.**",
    "While meatballs bake, cut broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then broccoli, remaining garlic and 2 tbsp water (dbl for 4 ppl). Stir together. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5-6 min. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "When potatoes are done, drain and return them to the same pot, off heat. Using a masher, mash 1 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp milk (dbl both for 4 ppl) into potatoes until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
    "Whisk together broth concentrate, BBQ sauce and 2 tbsp water (dbl for 4 ppl) in another large bowl. Set aside. When meatballs are done, transfer to BBQ sauce mixture. Stir together, until meatballs are fully coated in the sauce.",
    "Divide mashed potatoes between plates. Top with BBQ meatballs, spooning over any remaining sauce from the bowl. Sprinkle remaining chives over meatballs. Serve garlicky broccoli alongside."
