  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Wash and dry all produce. Cut potatoes into quarters. Toss potatoes with 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4ppl) on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in the middle of the oven, until golden-brown, 25-28 min.",
    "While potatoes roast, strip 1 tbsp thyme leaves (dbl for 4ppl) off stems. Roughly chop parsley. Peel, then mince or grate garlic. Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1 tsp oil (dbl for 4ppl), then beef. Cook, breaking up beef into smaller pieces, until no pink remains, 4-5 min.** Season with salt and pepper. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a large bowl. Discard any remaining beef fat in the pot.",
    "Reduce heat to medium, then add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4ppl), mirepoix, thyme and half the garlic to the same pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mirepoix softens slightly, 3-4 min. Add beef and any juices from the bowl. Sprinkle with flour. Cook, stirring often, until flour coats veggies and beef, 1-2 min.",
    "Add broth concentrates, 1 tbsp vinegar, 1/2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 1/2 cups water (dbl all for 4ppl) to the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium- low. Cook, stirring together, until stew thickens slightly and veggies are tender, 10-12 min.",
    "While stew cooks, combine remaining garlic and 1 tbsp oil (dbl for 4ppl) in a small bowl. Cut each roll in half lengthwise, then widthwise. Place rolls cut-side up another baking sheet and brush with garlic oil. Toast in the top of the oven, until lightly golden-brown, 5-6 min. (TIP: Keep an eye on your toast so that it does not burn!)",
    "Add roasted potatoes to the stew and stir to combine. Divide stew between bowls. Sprinkle parsley over both the stew and garlic toasts. Serve with garlic toast alongside."
