  "ingredients": [
    "2 bell peppers, cored and sliced",
    "2 onions, peeled and sliced",
    "2 x 400 g tin chopped tomatoes",
    "4 cloves garlic, crushed",
    "2 Tbs chopped fresh oregano or other fragrant herb",
    "4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
    "12 sausages",
    "8 eggs",
    "fresh parsley for garnish",
    "flaked sea salt",
    "freshly ground black pepper"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.",
    "Heat the olive oil in a large pan over a medium heat.",
    "Add onions and peppers with oregano, salt and pepper, and then cook for about 10 minutes. You want it to soften but not colour.",
    "Stir in the tomatoes and garlic, continue to cook until the peppers are soft and mixture is thick; at least 20 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile bake the sausages in the oven for about 20-30 minutes until cooked through.",
    "When everything is ready cut the sausages into chunks, mix into the peperonata and place in an ovenproof dish. Make wells in the mixture to take the eggs. Crack an egg into each hole and bake in the oven for roughly 10 minutes. The white should be set and the yolk still runny.",
    "Serve hot from the oven, with fresh parsley scattered over the top; either on its own or with a leafy green salad."
