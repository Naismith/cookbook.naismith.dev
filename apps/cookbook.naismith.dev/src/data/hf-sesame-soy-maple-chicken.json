  "directions": [
    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 425Â°F and wash and dry all produce. Peel, then mince or grate the garlic. Heat a medium pot over medium heat. When hot, add 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl), then the garlic and rice. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2-3 min. Add 1 1/4 cups water (dbl for 4 ppl) and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 12-14 min.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add the sesame seeds to the dry pan. Toast, stirring often, until golden-brown, 3-4 min. (TIP: Keep your eye on them so they don't burn!) Transfer to a small bowl. While the seeds toast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Add 1 tbsp oil, then the chicken to the same pan. (NOTE: Don't overcrowd the pan! Cook in batches for 4 ppl). Sear, until chicken is golden-brown, 1-2 min per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Bake in middle of oven, until chicken is cooked through, 10-12 min.**",
    "Cut the bok choy into 1/-2 inch pieces. Add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl) to the same pan, then the bok choy and onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are tender-crisp, 3-4 min. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a plate, and cover to keep warm.",
    "Reduce heat to medium-low. Add soy sauce, maple syrup and 1 tbsp water (dbl for 4 ppl) to the same pan. Whisk together, until slightly thickened, 2-3 min. Remove the pan from heat.",
    "Fluff the garlic rice with a fork. Season with salt. Stir in half the sesame seeds. Thinly slice the chicken. Divide the rice between plates. Top with veggies, then the chicken. Drizzle over the soy-maple sauce. Sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds."
