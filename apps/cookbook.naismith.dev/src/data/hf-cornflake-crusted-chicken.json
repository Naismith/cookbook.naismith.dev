    "Before starting, preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Wash and dry all produce. Add cornflakes to a large zip-top bag. Seal shut. Using a rolling pin, crush cornflakes into a breadcrumb-like texture. Add crushed cornflakes to a shallow dish. Season with salt and pepper. Brush 1/2 tbsp mayo (dbl for 4 ppl) over tops of chicken, then press mayo-coated tops into cornflakes.",
    "Add chicken to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Press any remaining cornflake crumbs on top, then drizzle 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl) over top. Bake chicken in the middle of the oven, until cooked through, 20-25 min.**",
    "Peel, then cut sweet potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Combine sweet potatoes, 1 tsp salt (dbl for 4 ppl) and enough water to cover (approx. 1-2 inches) in a large pot. (NOTE: Use same for 4 ppl.) Cover and bring to a boil over high heat.",
    "While sweet potatoes cook, cut broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Zest, then cut lemon into wedges. Peel, then mince or grate garlic. Mix together half the maple syrup, remaining mayo, 1 tsp lemon zest and 1/4 tsp garlic (dbl both for 4 ppl) in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
    "Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil and 1 tbsp butter (dbl both for 4 ppl). Stir together, until butter melts, 30 sec. Add broccoli, remaining garlic and 1 tbsp water (dbl for 4 ppl). Stir together. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is tender, 5-6 min. Season with salt and pepper.",
    "Reserve 2 tbsp of potato water (dbl for 4 ppl), then drain and return sweet potatoes to the same pot, off heat. Using a potato masher, mash in remaining maple syrup, reserved water and 1 tbsp butter (dbl for 4 ppl), until smooth. Season with pepper. Divide broccoli, mash and chicken between plates. Serve with maple dip on the side. Squeeze over a lemon wedge if desired."
